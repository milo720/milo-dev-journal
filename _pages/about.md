Welcome to my dev journal.

I created this site as a place to store a few blogs I had been creating and to see if what I was writing could prove useful to someone out there. This blog will contain sets of my writing on the software development profession, some quite technical others focusing more on soft skills.

This blog is hosted using github pages so please feel free to suggest updates or raise issues.

I hope you find something interesting or useful here.
